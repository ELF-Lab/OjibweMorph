# OjibweMorph Other Spreadsheets

:construction: This description is in progress :construction:

This folder houses the spreadsheets for the various "other" elements in Ojibwe that are not nouns, verbs, and preverbs. This includes adverbs, numerals, proper nouns, and various particles.

At present, these spreadsheets just have a single form for each "type" of element. Eventually, we will be updated things by adding inflection for proper nouns, since things like proper names can be inflected for obviation and the preterit marker.

For now, if you add a new type of lexical element, these spreadsheets will also need to be updated accordingly.
