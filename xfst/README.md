	- y2 appears in Cy noun class stems
	- w2 appears at the end of VV, VVw, Vw, and both regular and irregular Cw noun class stems

# Stem/Suffix Rules

- _y2-deletion:_ Always delete y2

- _d-deletion:_ Delete stem-final "d" when the suffix complex starts with a consonant.

- _Nasal assimilation:_ With stems ending in "m" (e.g. VAI stems "minongwaam"), the "m" changes to "n" when the suffix complex starts with "z" (negation), "g" (3SgProx in the conjunct), or "d" (inclusive simple imperative)

- *aw-to-aa:* For stems that end in "aw", the "aw" goes to "aa" when the suffix complex starts with "g" or "k".

- *aw-to-oo:* For stems that end in "aw", the "aw" goes to "oo" when the suffix complex starts with "n" or "s".

- *w-to-o:* For stems that end in "Cw", the "w" goes to "o" when the suffix complex starts with an "i" or "i1". AKA, wi -> o / C __
	- MUST PRECEED the "ShortV-deletion" rule
	- In Border Lakes, this rule only applies with non-word-final "Cwi" sequences. For example, we get "mizhwi" rather than "mizho" for the imerative form.

- *i1-Palatalization:* Stems ending in "n1" palatalize to "zh" and "s1" to "sh" when the suffix complex starts with the first person theme sign "i1".
  	- MUST PRECEED the "ShortV-deletion" rule

- _ShortV-deletion:_ Delete word-final short vowels in multi-syllabic words or mono-syllabic words with a long vowel (preseve the short vowel in mono-syllabic words with a short vowel, e.g. "makwa").
	- MUST PRECEED the "w-deletion" rule
	- MUST FOLLOW i1-Palatalization and w-to-o

- _w1-deletion:_ Delete word-final "w1" (occurs with neutral, positive 3sg)
	- MUST FOLLOW the "ShortV-deletion" rule

- _w2-deletion:_ w2 deletes word finally, before consonants, before vowels "o", before "oo", and before "V1" (so remains before vowels a, aa, i, ii, and e)
	- MUST PRECEDE ShortV-Lengthening
	- MUST FOLLOW Short-V deletion

- _ShortV-lengthening:_ a short vowel to the left of v1 lengthens (so i -> ii / _ v1, a -> aa / _ v1, o -> oo / _ v1)
	- MUST FOLLOW w2-Deletion

- _y-to-h:_ Turn y into h if it follows a long vowel + n sequence at the end of a word (y -> h / VVn_#)
	- This handles some stems that are encoded inconsistently in the OPD; a purely orthographic rule.

- _y-deletion:_ Delete y at the end of words (y -> 0 / _ #)
	- MUST PRECEDE h-deletion!
	- MUST FOLLOW Short-V deletion!
	- MUST FOLLOW y-to-h!

- _h-deletion (OPTIONAL!):_ Optionally delete h between n and y (h -> 0 / n_y)
	- MUST FOLLOW y-deletion!
	- Optional, only because sometimes the spelling convention of deleting that "h" is done inconsistently.
