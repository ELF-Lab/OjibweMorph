* A number of VTA-forms in Conjunct, Imperative and Independent order were manually checked and corrected together with Nancy Jones. Old forms in the spreadsheets were retained but with lower precedence in some cases (i.e. they've been assigned to Form2Surface or Form3Surface).  

* Added spreadhseets for all of the forms for "dependent" nouns, which have to take a possessed form.
