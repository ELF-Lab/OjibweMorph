# OjibweMorph Derivational Spreadsheets

:construction: This description is in progress :construction:

This folder houses the spreadsheets for derivational morphemes in Ojibwe. There are five column types:

* **Form:** The underlying form of the derivational suffix.
* **Tag:** The tag (analysis) that should be associated with the form.
* **InputParadigm:** The paradigm that a given derivational suffix can attach to.
* **InputClass:** The inflectional class that a given derivational suffix can attach to.
* **OutputParadigm:** The paradigm that a given derivational suffix creates when it attaches.
* **OutputClass:** The inflectional class that a given derivational suffix creates when it attaches.

At present, we are only modeling three types of derivational morphemes: the augment suffix _-magad_, the reflexive suffix _-dizo_ and the reciprocal suffix _-di_. Each one has various allomorphs associated with it, and the phonological rules apply to get the correct surface form.
