## General

*	Double \>\> marks the stem/suffix juncture (or the end of the stem)
*	Double \<\< marks the prefix/stem juncture (or the start of the stem)
*	Single \> marks boundaries between suffixes outside of the stem (not yet used)
*	Single \< marks boundaries between prefixes outside of the stem (not yet used)
*	Null morphemes will NOT be added unless a rule needs to refer to them. So far there are no such rules.
*	There are three special characters used in the nouns:
	*	V1, triggers vowel lengthening with certain preterit and delayed imperative forms in the VAIs.
	*	y2, appears in Cy noun class stems and is always deleted
	*	w2, appears at the end of VV, VVw, Vw, and both regular and irregular Cw noun class stems and is deleted unless the suffix complex starts with non-back vowels (a, aa, i, ii, and e)


## OTHER

Need to deal with "mishi", where the signular volwe is "i" rather than "a".

Need to deal with irregular diminutives in the VVny stem class.

## STACKING RULES

The first person plural suffix =inaan loses its final n when a preterit or locative suffix immediately follows it (final n is preserved with number/obviation marking)

The animate plural, inanimate plural, and obviative basic suffixes show up with an initial "i" rather than "a" after =inaan
	- This does not exactly match any of the noun classes.

The animate plural (-ag), inanimate plural (-an), obviative singular (-an), obviative plural (-a'), and locative (-ing) basic suffixes lose their initial vowel if whatever is to the left ends in a vowel
	- vowel hiatus rule

When a diminutive nouns also has a pejorative suffix, the diminutive suffix may change its s to zh; Pejorative nouns may undergo a change of some of the consonants in the stem when =(i)sh is added: an s or z near the end of the stem can change to zh.
	- probably, preterit is actually -i1sh, so triggers palatalization sort of like i1 does in verbs.
		- I have not seen any examples, though, of n palatalizing
		- Also, s/z -> zh, rather than sh; so this is a different rule
	- Might want this to be optional, since some speakers will "unwind" this according to Nichols.


Following the preterit suffix -ban, the "a" in the animate plural (-ag), inanimate plural (-an), obviative singular (-an), and obviative plural (-a') turns to "ii" or "e"
	- really, "-ban" is probably underlyingly "-bany", so behaves like a Class 5 Cy stem would

No Pret+Voc is allowed

Inflection of diminutive stems is generally regular; they are treated as a Class I stem, no matter what the class of the non-diminutive noun stem (Nichols 2010)

Other suffixes appear in the usual form for class 1 (consonant) stems following the pejorative suffix, including the personal suffixes and the basic suffixes (Nichols 2010)
