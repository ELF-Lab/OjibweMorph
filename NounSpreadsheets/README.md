STEM/SUFFIX RULES

y2-deletion: Always delete y2
	- y2 appears in Cy stems

w2-deletion: w2 deletes word finally, before consonants, before "o", before "oo", and before "V1" (so remains before vowels a, aa, i, ii, and e)
	- w2 appears at the end of VV, VVw, Vw, and both regular and irregular Cw stems
	- Must precede ShortV-Lengthening
	- Must follow Short-V deletion (used in the verbs)

ShortV-lengthening: a short vowel to the left of v1 lengthens (so i -> ii / _ v1, a -> aa / _ v1, o -> oo / _ v1)
	- Also used in the verbs
	- Must follow w2-Deletion

y-to-h: turn y into h if it follows a long vowel + n sequence at the end of a word (y -> h / VVn_#)
	- This will handle some stems that are encoded inconsistently
	- Also used in the verbs

y-deletion: Delete y at the end of words (y -> 0 / _ #)
	- Must precede h-deletion!
	- Must follow Short-V deletion!

h-deletion (OPTIONAL!): Optionally delete h between n and y (h -> 0 / n_y)
	- Must follow y-deletion!
	- Optional, only because sometimes the spelling convention of deleting that "h" is done inconsistently.

OTHER

Need to deal with "mishi", where the signular volwe is "i" rather than "a".

Need to deal with irregular diminutives in the VVny stem class.

STACKING RULES

The first person plural suffix =inaan loses its final n when a preterit or locative suffix immediately follows it (final n is preserved with number/obviation marking)

The animate plural, inanimate plural, and obviative basic suffixes show up with an initial "i" rather than "a" after =inaan
	- This does not exactly match any of the noun classes.

The animate plural (-ag), inanimate plural (-an), obviative singular (-an), obviative plural (-a'), and locative (-ing) basic suffixes lose their initial vowel if whatever is to the left ends in a vowel
	- vowel hiatus rule

When a diminutive nouns also has a pejorative suffix, the diminutive suffix may change its s to zh; Pejorative nouns may undergo a change of some of the consonants in the stem when =(i)sh is added: an s or z near the end of the stem can change to zh.
	- probably, preterit is actually -i1sh, so triggers palatalization sort of like i1 does in verbs.
		- I have not seen any examples, though, of n palatalizing
		- Also, s/z -> zh, rather than sh; so this is a different rule
	- Might want this to be optional, since some speakers will "unwind" this according to Nichols.


Following the preterit suffix -ban, the "a" in the animate plural (-ag), inanimate plural (-an), obviative singular (-an), and obviative plural (-a') turns to "ii" or "e"
	- really, "-ban" is probably underlyingly "-bany", so behaves like a Class 5 Cy stem would

No Pret+Voc is allowed

Inflection of diminutive stems is generally regular; they are treated as a Class I stem, no matter what the class of the non-diminutive noun stem (Nichols 2010)

Other suffixes appear in the usual form for class 1 (consonant) stems following the pejorative suffix, including the personal suffixes and the basic suffixes (Nichols 2010)
